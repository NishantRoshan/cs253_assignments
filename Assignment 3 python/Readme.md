Before running the code make sure that stopword dictionary is available in the device. If not, uncomment and add
<!-- import nltk
nltk.download("stopwords") -->
in the first lines of the code. It is to download the stopword distionary. Need to be done only the first time we are running the code, not the second time onwards.
